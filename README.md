# Unscented Kalman Filter

<img src="media/ukf_highway_tracked.gif" width="700" height="400" />

In this project I implemented an Unscented Kalman Filter to estimate the state of multiple cars on a highway using noisy lidar and radar measurements. 

The main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./ukf_highway
